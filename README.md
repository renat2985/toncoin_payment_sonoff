# Payment for Your Services via TonCoin

A convenient and fast way to implement paid services using the TonCoin cryptocurrency. The process is simple: You open any crypto wallet, scan the QR code (for example, it can be printed on a sheet with the required amount), transfer the specified amount, and as soon as the payment is received, the relay will activate and turn on your device for the time you set. This could be any device, from a kettle, coffee machine, or light bulb to powering electricity in a room or another location.

You can assemble the device yourself or ask to build it for you. To order a ready-made device, contact me via [Telegram](https://t.me/ESPiotDevice), [Skype](https://skype:renat2985?chat), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zaGaDuGe).
We have a similar project with a screen, [check it out](https://github.com/renat2985/toncoin_payment).

### Key Features:

1. **Device Connection:**
   - When first powered on, if the device can‚Äôt find the router or if you press the button on the ESP itself, it will create an access point named ‚ÄúTonCoin payments.‚Äù
     
     <img src="https://github.com/renat2985/toncoin_payment_sonoff/blob/main/doc/WiFi.png" width="200px">
   - Connect to this access point (no password needed) and open a browser, then enter http://192.168.4.1. Usually, after connecting to Wi-Fi, the Captive portal will automatically open and redirect you to the desired page.

   - Click "Configure WiFi" to proceed with the setup.

2. **Device Configuration:**
   - **Router and Password:** Enter your Wi-Fi connection details.
   - **Device Name:** Specify a device name, e.g., "Buy coffee."
   - **Your Toncoin Wallet:** Enter your wallet address to receive payments.
   - **CoinMarketCap API:** Is a service that allows you to get the current TonCoin price in fiat currency. For testing, you can use the default API, but if you plan to use the device on a regular basis, it is highly recommended to register on the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) website and get your own API. The free version allows up to 10,000 requests per month for price data. This is more than enough for 10 devices, but if our API is used by more devices, not everyone will be able to receive the actual price, and as a result, payments may fail.
   - **Currency:** Select the currency in which you want to receive payments (EUR, USD, RUB, BYN, BGN, GBP, etc.). This is necessary for automatic conversion to TonCoin based on the current exchange rate, updated hourly through coinmarketcap.com.
   - **Service Currency Price:** Specify the price in your selected currency that the customer should pay.
   - **Payment Tolerance:** In this field, specify the acceptable price deviation. Since the Ton price constantly fluctuates, you need to indicate a deviation range (as a single number) that you are willing to accept for payment.
   - **Relay Work Time:** Specify how long the relay should be activated in seconds. This can range from one second (for simulating a button press) to several minutes or hours.
